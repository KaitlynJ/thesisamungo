Urgent care centers are a relatively new and emergent phenomemnon in the American health care system, yet little to no academic reasearch has been performed on how they are situated in the larger sociological understanding of the healthcare system. This thesis attempts to further such an understanding by examining the typologies of patients which are the users of urgent care, and further, who of those uses such centers as their primary care physicians.

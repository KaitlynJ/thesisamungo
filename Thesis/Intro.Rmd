Over the last two decades, urgent care centers have proliferated in the United States, growing to 9,000 facilities  as of 2014 (Yee 2013). Such recent and rapid expansion of the industry has been heavily examined by the media, which often attribute growth to a diverse set of market factors such as long wait times for primary care appointments, crowded emergency departments and patient demand for more accessible care, including after-hours appointments (Yee, Lechner, and Boukus 2013). 

Yet despite the rapid development of the industry and the great interest sociologists have historically taken in Americaâ€™s health care system, hardly any scholarly research has been done on why these centers are coming to play a major part of the healthcare system or what their patterns of use are. WHile many are quick to point towards long wait times, and the difficulty of finding doctors in the current healthcare system, the repurcussions of the new turn torwards urgent care centers. 

In the following analysis, I will attempt to situate the rise of such clinics within the existing sociological research, generating hypotheses about why patients are turning towards such centers and away from primary care and/or emergency department use. Drawing on research studying the sociology of medicine and using advanced statistical clustering methods, this thesis seeks to understand what the key characteristics are of individuals choosing to go to urgent care. To do so, I will utilize the clustering method of unsupervised learning in order to better understand if and what subgroups appear within the group of patients who have begun to use urgent care rather than traditional means of procuring healthcare.

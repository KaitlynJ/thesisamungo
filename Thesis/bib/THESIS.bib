	abstract = {The present article reviews, in relation to quantitative work on the social structure, papers published in Sociology of Health and Illness during its first 25 years. Each issue published during the years 1979-2002 has been examined; and quantitative papers, relating to various aspects of the social structure, have been identified. Such papers are found to have formed a minor but substantively significant theme within the Journal. These contributions situate the journal between sociology and social epidemiology. Articles in the Journal, for example, have been part of sociological debates about the measurement of social class, and of social epidemiological debates about the relationship between income distribution and population health. The contribution of Sociology of Health and Illness to a number of such debates is reviewed. The article concludes that the present situation, in particular the intellectual crisis in social epidemiology and social science investment in large data sets, gives the Journal the chance to build on this distinguished tradition by encouraging, through its publication policy, the further development of quantitative medical sociology.},

We then describe theoretical and epistemological issues with scholars’ treatment of technology in medicine. Using symbolic interactionist concepts, as well as work from the interdisciplinary field of science and technology studies, we review and synthesize critical connections in and across sociology’s intellectual relationship with medical technology. Next, we discuss key findings in these literatures, noting a shift from a focus on the effects of technology on practice to a reconfiguration of human bodies. We also look toward the future, focusing on connections between technoscientific identities and embodied health movements. Finally, we call for greater engagement by medical sociologists in studying medical technology and the process of policy-making—two areas central to debates in health economics and public policy.},

	abstract = {One goal of the Affordable Care Act is to improve patients’ access to primary care and the coordination of that care. An important ingredient in achieving that goal is ensuring that patients have access to their primary care practice outside of regular business hours. This analysis of the 2010 Health Tracking Household Survey found that among people with a usual source of primary care, 40.2 percent reported that their practice offered extended hours, such as at night or on weekends. The analysis also found that one in five people who attempted after-hours contact with their primary care provider reported it was “very difficult” or “somewhat difficult” to reach a clinician. Those who reported less difficulty contacting a clinician after hours had significantly fewer emergency department visits (30.4 percent compared to 37.7 percent) and lower rates of unmet medical need (6.1 percent compared to 13.7 percent) than people who experienced more difficulty. The findings provide a valuable baseline on after-hours access, especially as patient-centered medical homes and accountable care organizations expand. Increasing support to primary care practices to offer or coordinate after-hours care may help reduce rates of emergency department use and unmet medical need.},

	abstract = {Background
Due to long waits for primary care appointments and extended emergency department wait times, newer sites for episodic primary care services, such as urgent care centers, have developed. However, little is known about these centers. The purpose of this study is to provide information about the organization and functioning of urgent care centers based on a nationally representative U.S. sample.

Methods
We conducted a mail survey with telephone follow-up of urgent care centers identified via health insurers' websites, internet searches, and a trade association mailing list. Descriptive statistics are presented.

Results
Urgent care centers are open beyond typical office hours, and their scope of services is broader than that of many primary care offices. While these characteristics are similar to hospital emergency departments, such centers employ significant numbers of family physicians. The payer distribution is similar to that of primary care, and physicians' average salaries are comparable to those for family physicians overall. Urgent care centers report early adoption of electronic health records, though our findings are qualified by a lack of strictly comparable data.

Conclusion
While their hours and scope of services reflect some characteristics of emergency departments, urgent care centers are in many ways similar to family medicine practices. As the health care system evolves to cope with expanding demands in the face of limited resources, it is unclear how patients with episodic care needs will be treated, and what role urgent care centers will play in their care.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES. The authors assess the association between having a regular doctor and presentation for nonurgent versus urgent emergency department visits while controlling for potential confounders such as sociodemographics, health status, and comorbidity. METHODS. A cross-sectional study was conducted in emergency departments of five urban teaching hospitals in the northeast. Adult patients presenting with chest pain, abdominal pain, or asthma (n = 1696; 88\% of eligible) were studied. Patients completed a survey on presentation, reporting sociodemographics, health status, comorbid diseases, and relationship with a regular doctor. Urgency on presentation was assessed by chart review using explicit criteria. RESULTS. Of the 1,696 study participants, 852 (50\%) presented with nonurgent complaints. In logistic regression analyses, absence of a relationship with a regular physician was an independent correlate of presentation for a nonurgent emergency department visit (odds ratio 1.6; 95\% confidence interval 1.2, 2.2) when controlling for age, gender, marital status, health status, and comorbid diseases. Race, lack of insurance, and education were not associated with nonurgent use. CONCLUSIONS. Absence of a relationship with a regular doctor was correlated with use of the emergency department for selected nonurgent conditions when controlling for important potential confounders. Our study suggests that maintaining a relationship with a regular physician may reduce nonurgent use of the emergency department regardless of insurance status or health status.},

A grounded theory approach including cycles of immersion/crystallization was used to identify themes and reportable interpretations. Patients reported multiple decision-making considerations that hinged on whether or not they knew about primary care options. A model is developed depicting the complexity and variation in patients’ decision-making to use the ED. Optimizing health system navigation and use requires improving objective factors such as access and costs as well as subjective perceptions of patients’ health care, which are also a prominent part of their decision-making process.},

To understand why patients seek care at these clinics and what their experiences were like, the authors interviewed 61 patients at 6 retail clinics. Patients were satisfied with the overall experience and were attracted to retail clinics because of their convenient locations and fixed, transparent pricing. Patients who had a primary care physician (PCP) sought care at these clinics primarily because their PCPs were not available in a timely manner. If retail clinics had not been available, a quarter of patients report they would have gone to the emergency department.

This power dependency arrangement is to some extent based on both fact and faith; the fact that the physician has some expertise and the faith that the physician's actions will have the desired results in this specific situation. A number of factors can alter this arrangement, however. For example, biomedical innovations often produce more than routine uncertainty for the physician in clinical practice, resulting at times in a reduction in professional control and correspondingly an increase in the potential discretionary power of the patient. While some patients may readily accept an increase in their role as health decision-maker, many attempt to have the doctor exercise as much discretionary power in novel as in more routinized medical situations. As a result, one finds in developing areas of medicine a multiplicity of negotiated doctor-patient exchanges, some approximating traditional doctor-patient interaction and others exhibiting more of a collegial decision-making structure. One rapidly developing area of medicine, clinical genetics, is examined with particular attention given to types of doctor-patient exchanges and the social forces that condition these relationships.},

Stress-buffering processes also involve these mechanisms. I argue that there are two broad types of support, emotional sustenance and active coping assistance, and two broad categories of supporters, significant others and experientially similar others, who specialize in supplying different types of support to distressed individuals. Emotionally sustaining behaviors and instrumental aid from significant others and empathy, active coping assistance, and role modeling from similar others should be most efficacious in alleviating the physical and emotional impacts of stressors.},

In this article, we discuss three central findings in the sociology of health services: (1) health services in the U.S. are unequally distributed, contributing to health inequalities across status groups; (2) social institutions reproduce health care inequalities by constraining and enabling the actions of health service organizations, health care providers, and consumers; and (3) the structure and dynamics of health care organizations shape the quality, effectiveness, and outcomes of health services for different groups and communities. We conclude with a discussion of the policy implications of these findings for future health care reform efforts.},

Patient roles have become more active, diverse, long-term, and risk-based, while patient—provider relationships are multifaceted, less paternalistic, and more pivotal to health outcomes. Extensive literatures on help-seeking show how much social influences affect both undertreatment and inappropriate high utilization of health care. The challenge in trying to contain the growth of health care costs is two-fold: developing better ways of defining need for care and promoting better access for those who could benefit most from health care. Both of these strategies need to be considered in the context of addressing racial, ethnic, socioeconomic, and health status disparities. Rebuilding the primary care sector as a sociologically informed strategy and a key component of health care reform may optimize both health care delivery and patient outcomes.},

We then examine three recent challenges to the profession that exemplify the tension between self-interest and collective altruism to act in the best interest of patients: (1) the rise of patient consumerism, (2) the advent of evidence-based medicine, and (3) the increasing power of the pharmaceutical industry. We show the resilience of the medical profession as it adapts and transforms in response to these challenges.

The analysis builds on and extends scholarship concerning the growing influence of lay expertise in the context of medical uncertainty by showing how the dominant beliefs and routine practices of this electronic community simultaneously (and paradoxically) challenge the expertise of physicians and encourage the expansion of medicine's jurisdiction. Drawing on their shared embodied expertise, participants confirm the medical character of their problem and its remedy, and they empower each other to search for physicians who will recognize and treat their condition accordingly. Physician compliance is introduced as a useful concept for understanding the relationship between lay expertise, patient-consumer demand, and contemporary (and future) instances of medicalization.},

	abstract = {Much emphasis has been placed recently in sociological, policy and popular discourses on changes in lay people's attitudes towards the medical profession that have been labelled by some as a move towards the embracing of “consumerism”. Notions of consumerism tend to assume that lay people act as “rational” actors in the context of the medical encounter. They align with broader sociological concepts of the “reflexive self” as a product of late modernity; that is, the self who acts in a calculated manner to engage in self-improvement and who is sceptical about expert knowledges. To explore the ways that people think and feel about medicine and the medical profession, this article draws on findings from a study involving in-depth interviews with 60 lay people from a wide range of backgrounds living in Sydney. These data suggest that, in their interactions with doctors and other health care workers, lay people may pursue both the ideal-type “consumerist” and the “passive patient” subject position simultaneously or variously, depending on the context. The article concludes that late modernist notions of reflexivity as applied to issues of consumerism fail to recognize the complexity and changeable nature of the desires, emotions and needs that characterize the patient-doctor relationship.},

Consumer groups make similar assumptions when exhorting individuals to treat health care like any other service. This paper enquires to what extent patients conceive of themselves and others as adopting consumerist behaviour when seeking and evaluating primary health care. Three hundred and thirty-three patients attending general practices in Sydney, Australia, were asked in open-ended questions to state why they chose their regular doctor, why they continued to visit that doctor, if they had ever changed their doctor, if they thought most people could tell if a doctor were good or bad, and what qualities they thought constituted a good and bad doctor. It is concluded that the patients surveyed tended not think of themselves as consumers who should be wary of the quality of service offered by doctors. Rather they preferred to trust their doctor, and therefore did not devote effort to actively seeking out information about their doctor or evaluating his or her services.},

Consistent with earlier studies, patients tended to report less physician utilization than was recorded in the computerized provider records. However, they also tended to report slightly more emergency room visits than were reported in the computerized utilization records. There was no association between demographic or health variables and the tendency toward discrepancy between self-report and computerized utilization record reports. However, there was a tendency for the discrepancy to increase as the amount of record utilization increased. Thus, the likelihood of bias caused by differing demographic factors is low, but researchers should take into account that underreporting occurs and is likely to increase as utilization increases.},

SETTING: Washington, D.C. census tracts with ≥30\% of households below 200\% of federal poverty threshold. PARTICIPANTS: Women over age 40 (N = 1,205), 82\% of whom were African American. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The response rate was 85\%. Primary care performance was assessed using women's ratings of their systems' accessibility (organizational, geographic, and financial), continuity, comprehensiveness, and coordination. Respondents' ratings of trust in their physicians, communication with their physicians, and compassion shown by their physicians were used to operationalize the patient-physician relationship. Controlling for population and insurance characteristics, 4 primary care features were positively associated with women's trust in and communication with their physicians: continuity with a single clinician, organizational accessibility of the practice, comprehensive care, and coordination of specialty care services. Better organizational access, but not geographic or financial access, was associated with greater levels of trust, compassion, and communication (odds ratios [ORs], 3.2, 7.4, and 6.9, respectively; P≤ .01). Women who rated highest their doctor's ability to take care of all of their health care needs (highest level of comprehensiveness) had 11 times the odds of trusting their physician (P≤ .01) and 6 times the odds of finding their physicians compassionate and communicative (P≤ .01), compared to those with the lowest level of comprehensiveness. CONCLUSIONS: Primary care delivery sites organized to be more accessible, to link patients with the same clinician for their visits, to provide for all of a woman's health care needs, and to coordinate specialty care services are associated with stronger relationships between low-income women and their physicians. Primary care systems that fail to emphasize these features of primary care may jeopardize the clinician-patient relationship and indirectly the quality of care and health outcomes.},

Today, the word "relationship" as applied to the doctor-patient experience may be a misnomer--or at least an inappropriate description of the experience. One could ask, for example, if a person's most recent physician visit was more akin to their encounter with their last cab driver, or the person who sold them their last pair of shoes. After reviewing the 20th century theoretical conceptions of the doctor-patient relationship and describing the state of illness and health care delivery and policy in the United States, we develop a theoretical rubric for examining the 21st century physician-patient relationship. We argue that while patients should continue to be educated on how to use their time with physicians effectively and efficiently and physicians should continue to improve their communication with patients, we also argue that for policy purposes, it is not the physician or the patient that needs to change but rather the pressures and constraints of the organizational context within which the doctor-patient encounter takes place.},

Prior to the last two decades, the relationship was predominantly between a patient seeking help and a doctor whose decisions were silently complied with by the patient. In this paternalistic model of the doctor-patient relationship, the doctor utilises his skills to choose the necessary interventions and treatments most likely to restore the patient's health or ameliorate his pain. Any information given to the patient is selected to encourage them to consent to the doctor's decisions. This description of the asymmetrical or imbalanced interaction between doctor and patient [Parsons T. The social system. Free Press, New York, 1951.]1 has been challenged during the last 20 years. Critics have proposed a more active, autonomous and thus patient-centred role for the patient who advocates greater patient control, reduced physician dominance, and more mutual participation. This patient-centred approach has been described as one where “the physician tries to enter the patient's world, to see the illness through the patient's eyes” [McWhinney I. The need for a transformed clinical method. In: Stewart M, Roter D, Communicating with medical patients. London: Sage, 1989.]2, and has become the predominant model in clinical practice today.},

In the 1970s, two major studies established doctor-patient interaction as a viable research domain. In the present review, we consider approaches to the medical interview developing from these initiatives and that have a primary focus on observable features of doctor-patient interaction. Within this orientation, we consider literature dealing with social, moral, and technical dilemmas that physicians and patients face in primary care and the resources that they deploy in solving them. This literature embodies a steady evolution away from a doctor-centered emphasis toward a more balanced focus on the conduct of doctors and patients together.},

This article argues for a more dynamic theoretical vision of the clinical encounter: one that shifts attention away from a Parsonian ‘paradigm’ of professional–patient interaction towards a perspective that incorporates the systemic changes that late modernity brings to medicine.The clinical encounter is no longer the dyadic system envisaged by Parsons, and his theoretical perspective–which has played an important part in framing sociological accounts of the practice of medicine – now needs to be reframed in relation to the organizing impulses of contemporary corporate professional practice.},

Focusing on the process of market reform in U.S. healthcare during the last thirty years, this study finds systematic variation in the dimensions used to differentiate discourse on organizational forms such as hospitals, health maintenance organizations, and nursing homes. Discourse in the sector suggests that the symbolic integration of forms along the dimension of accessibility during the heyday of welfare state policies has given way to symbolic integration along clinical and functional dimensions with the rise of neoliberal ideologies. These segregating and blending processes are discussed as a general response to uncertainty and the desire for ontological security among organizational actors.},

The study uses qualitative methods to examine the nature of this collaboration by calling attention to the ways in which the biomedical profession manages to secure its boundaries and to protect its hard-core professional knowledge. It identifies the processes of exclusion and marginalization as the main mechanisms by which symbolic boundaries are marked daily in the professional field. These processes enable the biomedical profession to contain its competitors and at the same time to avoid overt confrontations and mitigate potential tensions between the two medical systems.},

This article examines the boundaries of identification described by three groups living in a Southern English new town. The three groups systematically differed in their volumes of economic, cultural and social resources, and patterns of geographical mobility. Members identified themselves as belonging within each group through interpretations of shared social practices and orientations toward everyday life. Boundaries drawn between `Us' and `Them' by all three groups were based on generic social categorizations of class and expressed through socio-economic, cultural and moral frameworks of status evaluation. However, identifications were asymmetrical because two groups, the closest in terms of resource volumes, differentiated from one another despite employing the same frameworks for evaluating status. Internal differences were also apparent in the third group; those who had lived in the area longest offered greater degrees of specificity and certainty when identifying `Us'. It is argued that the relationship between class and identification is not straightforward. In this case, the organization of the town's social relations, with its normative conventions and local reputations, coupled with respondents' different patterns of geographical mobility acted to configure interpretations of who constituted `Us' and `Them'.},

We examine the work of actors to create, maintain, and disrupt the practices that are considered legitimate within a field (practice work) and the boundaries between sets of individuals and groups (boundary work), and the interplay of these two forms of institutional work in effecting change. We find that actors' boundary work and practice work operate in recursive configurations that underpin cycles of institutional innovation, conflict, stability, and restabilization. We also find that transitions between these cycles are triggered by combinations of three conditions: (1) the state of the boundaries, (2) the state of practices, and (3) the existence of actors with the capacity to undertake the boundary and practice work of a different institutional process. These findings contribute to untangling the paradox of embedded agency—how those subject to the institutions in a field can effect changes in them. We also contribute to an understanding of the processes and mechanisms that drive changes in the institutional lifecycle.},

	abstract = {In this article we examine how social capital affects the creation of human capital. Specifically, we study how college students' peers affect academic performance. Building on existing research, we consider the different types of peers in the academic context and the various mechanisms through which peers affect performance. We test our model using data from an engineering college in India. Our data include information about the performance of individual students as well as their randomly assigned roommates, chosen friends, and chosen study-partners. We find that students with able roommates perform better, and the magnitude of this roommate effect increases when the roommate's skills match the student's academic goals. We also find that students benefit equally from same-and different-caste roommates, suggesting that social similarity does not strengthen peer effects. Finally, although we do not find strong evidence for independent friendship or study-partner effects, our results suggest that roommates become study-partners, and in so doing, affect performance. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that peer effects are a consequential determinant of academic achievement.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE Numerous primary care practice development efforts, many related to the patient-centered medical home (PCMH), are emerging across the United States with few guides available to inform them. This article presents a relationship-centered practice development approach to understand practice and to aid in fostering practice development to advance key attributes of primary care that include access to first-contact care, comprehensive care, coordination of care, and a personal relationship over time.
METHODS Informed by complexity theory and relational theories of organizational learning, we built on discoveries from the American Academy of Family Physicians’ National Demonstration Project (NDP) and 15 years of research to understand and improve primary care practice.
RESULTS Primary care practices can fruitfully be understood as complex adaptive systems consisting of a core (a practice’s key resources, organizational structure, and functional processes), adaptive reserve (practice features that enhance resilience, such as relationships), and attentiveness to the local environment. The effectiveness of these attributes represents the practice’s internal capability. With adequate motivation, healthy, thriving practices advance along a pathway of slow, continuous developmental change with occasional rapid periods of transformation as they evolve better fits with their environment. Practice development is enhanced through systematically using strategies that involve setting direction and boundaries, implementing sensing systems, focusing on creative tensions, and fostering learning conversations.
CONCLUSIONS Successful practice development begins with changes that strengthen practices’ core, build adaptive reserve, and expand attentiveness to the local environment. Development progresses toward transformation through enhancing primary care attributes.},

	abstract = {Although previous research has shown that the structure of groups or clusters of hospitals depends upon environmental characteristics of local service areas, little work has been done to demonstrate the importance of specifying the appropriate environmental framework for hospital clusters of varying composition. Clusters composed of only community general hospitals are affected primarily by the characteristics of the local community or service area, whereas clusters composed of both community hospitals and tertiary care hospitals (such as teaching hospitals or Veterans' Administration Hospitals) must respond to both local contingencies and extra-local constraints, such as the regional demands for specialized care and the teaching and/or research activities of other tertiary care hospitals. Thus, the presence of a tertiary care facility within a hospital cluster may alter significantly the context of the cluster. Using longitudinal data on national samples of tertiary and nontertiary care settings, I tested several hypotheses concerning the structure and environmental responsiveness of community hospital clusters in these different contexts.},

Two analyses are computed, based on similarities of intergenerational mobility inflows and of residential patterns. In both analyses the farm versus nonfarm distinction is the most basic. The second level divides occupations into middle- and working-class clusters. These clusters lend support to a hypothesis of proletarianization of white-collar work; embourgeoisement, manual-nonmanual, middle-mass, and knowledge-technocracy theories are not supported. In both analyses, the majority of clericals and, in the second analysis, technicians are more similar to manual workers than to middle-class occupations. An analysis of friendship choices lends further support to the location of clericals among the working class. The results also document the promise of cluster analysis as a major analytical tool far analyzing social structures.},

Consistent with social exchange and group positions theories, the study finds that whites are least open to out-dating and that, unlike blacks, Asians and Latinos have patterns of racial exclusion similar to those of whites. Like blacks, higher earning groups including Asian Indians, Middle Easterners and Asian men are highly excluded, suggesting that economic incorporation may not mirror acceptance in intimate settings. Finally, racial exclusion in dating is gendered; Asian males and black females are more highly excluded than their opposite-sex counterparts, suggesting that existing theories of race relations need to be expanded to account for gendered racial acceptance.},

Data from interviews with 842 randomly selected adults indicate that: virtually everyone performs some HPB activities, the most commonly performed activities do not involve use of the health care system, several clusters of HPB emerge when the data are subjected to cluster analysis, HPB does not differ markedly by health condition of the respondents, and some Health Belief Model variables are moderately associated with the performance of activities within selected HPB clusters. These findings are compatible with a view of individuals as "producers" of health rather than simply consumers of health care.},

The hierarchy of clustering reveals convergences, divergences, and potential influences among them. Centrality in the field corresponds to size of specialty, while dimensions of differentiation reflect shared substantive content.},

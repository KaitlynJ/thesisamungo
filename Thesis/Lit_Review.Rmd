# Theoretical and Historical Foundations {.unnumbered}
\onehalfspacing

In this chapter, the quantitative, visit level analysis of urgent care centers that follows later will be situated in the longer-term primarcy care trends of the American healthcare system. The existing sociological research on the patient and practioner, and how this has changed over the last half-century, are vitally impotant to beggining to understand how urgent care centers may be operating, as changes in the last half century have had drastic effect on this relationship. To understand the how and the why of urgent care centers, one must have some inkling of the complicated and tangled history of the medical profession in the US, and how infrastructural changes and epistomological shifts have led to the current state of affairs. To begin with, the chapter returns to the traditional tales of the primary care physician *still* visible in modern sociological texts on healthcare. Tracing the development and subsequent decline of medical professional power, I then review much of the current literature regarding the consequences of such structural changes on the doctor/patient relationship. These changes lead us to the current epistomology of American healthcare, and I review theories on the patient as consumer which strengthen the argument that urgent care centers can and *should* be studied by academics interested in the field. 


### The man, the myth, the legend: \\Understanding the Doctors of Yesteryear {.unnumbered}

In 2006, the Millis report [@CITE], commisioned by the American Medical Association, was asked to review the current status of physicians in the US. In the first section, the recalled the physician of revered memory in America:

\singlespace

> "The general practitioner of revered memory knew his patients… and provided continuing care through the course of minor ailments and majors emergencies. His deficiencies… were partly offset by intimate knowledge of his patients, the support he gave them, and the trust and confidence his services engendered.”

Such a view of the doctor occurs profusely throughout early to mid twentieth century literature on the profession, and is even visible today, though often as a thing to be reminisced, or a goal to return to. A person's doctor, traditionally, was an extrememly integrated, close, and important connection in a person's life. This was a relationsihp built, for some on trust, agency, and mutual understanding, while for others on power imbalance, technocratic authority and affective neutrality.

Importantly, in both cases the doctor is an embedded social tie in the patient's life.

##The end of Medical Professional Dominance in the US?{.unnumbered}

Almost since sociologists first became interested in the medical profession, the sociology of medicine was deeply joined with studies of professionalism. In the U.S., Doctors were seen as the paragon of the ‘professional’: respected, organized, in control, and above all else, firmly established in their positions. Such traits led many to study what effects this had on medical care and how such professional dominance of medical practitioners shaped what services were provided. Many found that such dominance allowed the profession to block off areas of study entirely, or to ignore diseases they did not want to pursue. Such “modern doctors” worked within a “sovereign profession” (Starr 1982), serenely dispensing both medical care and authoritative judgment. Freidson (1988, p.384) comments that before 1970’s, U.S. medicine “was at a historically unprecedented peak of prestige, prosperity and political and cultural influence—perhaps as autonomous as it is possible for a profession to be.”

When one thinks of the healthcare industry today, it is hard to call to mind such professional cohesion. While doctors remain one of the more highly respected career choices in America, their prestige has certainly dropped since the 20th century (Heritage and Maynard 2006). The term doctor is now applicable to a wide variety of sub-professions and specialties and the medical profession has become extremely diversified. Along with such specialization, big changes to Medicare and Medicaid legislation and the growth of third-party payers and for-profit medical service corporations created conditions which further removed the doctor from their traditional roles, eroding the political and cultural influence of the profession and threatening the cultural authority and technical autonomy of medicine (Starr 1982, Freidson 1988). It should be noted that such changes may not have necessitated a loss of professional dominance. In fact, with the expansive growth on spending in the healthcare sector, it is possible that doctors could have further cemented their professional medical authority. But most scholars have observed that the opposite has happened, and instead many view the past 30 years as the end of the authoritative medical professional. 

With such a history of professional prominence, many have examined the observed decline in depth, and the change is largely seen as a consequence of a loss of trust with the medical profession as a whole that began some time around the late 1970’s (Timmermans and Oh 2010). During the ‘golden age’, public surveys reported extremely high levels of trust in physicians, however this declined from 72 percent in 1966 to 37 percent in 1981 (Lipset and Schneider 1982). With high levels of doubt towards medical professionals, suspicion grew about physicians acting in patients’ best interests (Reeder 1972) and patients began to question the validity of the medical doctor as an authoritative figure of biological truth. 

These shifts in the medical profession occurred parallel to changing norms surrounding the role of the patient in their own health care, and the last 30 years of scholarly research have seen a reconfiguration of the patient from passive recipient of care from their doctor to a critical consumer of health services (Barker 2008; Lupton, Donaldson, and Lloyd 1991; Timmermans and Oh 2010). Theories of medical consumerism developed from economists studying the healthcare sector, and they begin with a similar hypothesis as the economic rational choice model, assuming that patients act as rational actors in the context of a medical encounter (Timmermans and Oh 2010). In other words, individuals act in a calculated manner to engage in self-improvement or health, and they are generally skeptical about expert knowledge (Lupton 1997). According to the literature, this trend began to express itself in the form of solicitation of second opinions and a sense of interchangeability of medical practitioners during the 1980’s, just as distrust of the industry reached its peak (Gray 1997). The idea that patients could shop around and compare services and prices was heavily popularized, and patients increasingly began to make autonomous decisions when selecting physicians (Hibbard and Weeks 1987, Lupton 1991).

Urgent care centers fit neatly into such a conceptualization of health services, and thus offer a key area of analysis in better understanding the developing roles of the consumer-patient within the larger healthcare industry. An important aspect of the research on the developing patient-consumers emphasizes the expansion of bargaining power on the part of the patient that came with the shift (Reeder 1972). A patient may now shop around the marketplace of health care, and that many are now choosing urgent care centers is undeniable given the industry’s rapid expansion. 


## Primacy of Primary Care

Turning away from the fate of doctoring, it is important to ackknoledge that the fate of primary care physicians has been reported to be hanging in the balance for quite some time. In 2006, the American College of Physicians released a report with the ominous title "The Impending Collapse of Primary Care Medicine and Its Implications for the State of the Nation's Health Care" (ACP, 2006)



## Moving away from Primary Care {.unnumbered}

The shift towards urgent care centers will undoubtedly have profound consequences for the patient-practitioner relationship and the patient’s role in the medical care system, but so far these consequences remain largely unknown. Fortunately, sociologists have had a long-standing concern with such professional-client interactions, particularly within medicine (Freidson 1961, Bloom 1963, Mechanic 1968), and in order to better understand what effects the shift away from primary care may have on patients, one can look to a large body of research on how institutional and organizational environments directly affect a patient’s experience in health care.

A major sociological theory of the doctor-patient relationship begins by speculating that the bureaucratization of modern social institutions has had drastic consequences on the medical profession: as opportunities for close personal contacts diminish, problems which were originally handled in familial, social, and religious contexts are transferred to ‘formal sustaining practitioners’ (Mechanic 1966). In such societies, the prescribed structure of the doctor patient relationship then provides a legitimation for the expression of intimacy and the request for help, offering an explanation as to why sociologists and anthropologists of medicine have long observed the variance and social nature of health problems brought to a physician (The Doctor, His Patient, and the Illness). 

These same theorists locate the stability of this doctor-patient relationship in the fact that the physician acts as the patient’s agent, yet one can immediately recognize that urgent care centers may not be equipped to facilitate this relationship in the same way that the traditional primary care practice is seen to (Lupton 1997). The premise of urgency in such practices, the quickness with which patients are seen, and the targeted focus on acute problems all serve to create considerable doubt towards the ability of physicians within such an organizational context to fulfill the sociological role thought so important in previous literature.

Additionally, those who study health services have recognized that a patient’s medical history is a primary source of information regarding treatment, and primary care practitioners have been known to draw upon this as a valuable resource (Draper and Smits 1975; Miller et al. 2010). 

Urgent care centers however have no emphasis on maintaining patient-doctor ties and there is no reliable system to ensure a patient sees the same doctor even if they have been there before.

Yet while this may seem problematic, a large body of recent sociological literature belongs to a growing number of scholars who are challenging the importance, and even relevance, of the traditional primary care physician in modern medicine. Those who have been observing developments in the patient-physician relationship over the past 30 years argue that the last quarter of the 20th century saw a dramatic reconfiguration of society, especially in regards to health services,  which has had profound effects on an individual’s relationship to the healthcare system. So while some were witnessing what was, for Starr (1982), “the social transformation of medicine,” and for many, “the end of the golden age of doctoring” (McKinlay & Marceau 2002). 


###What does this mean for health care?{.unnumbered}

In light of such research, sociologists and those who study at the intersection of health and social behaviors have begun to re-examine the importance of a close relationship between doctor and patient in an attempt to respond to the consumer-patient model, developing a growing body of research which seeks to define the most effective components of patient-physician interactions and to reaffirm the place of the primary care physician in modern medicine. Common to most of these studies are the elements of ‘trust, compassion, communication, and clinical competence’ (Heritage and Maynard 2006; Phillips and Bazemore 2010, others at bottom). As an example, a 2002 study on clinical outcomes for low income women over the age of forty found that women who rated highest their doctor's ability to take care of all of their health care needs had 11 times the odds of ‘trusting their physician’ and 6 times the odds of finding their physicians ‘compassionate and communicative’, compared to those with the lowest level of comprehensiveness (O’Malley and Forrest 2002).

With such knowledge that close ties between physicians and patients have a direct impact on the perceived quality of care, the importance of examining the rise of urgent care centers become obvious. If patients are acting as rational consumers, which of them are choosing to receive their care outside of a primary care office, and what consequences does this have for their medical outcomes? The lack of research into the characteristics of urgent care patients make it difficult to answer such questions. Indeed, as of now, there has been no academic attempt to place the rapidly growing industry within the sociology of medicine, nor does there even exist an official definition of what constitutes an urgent care center.
